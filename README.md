Project: Food online shopping tool (Calorie tracking)  
Team members: Yinfei Lu, Xuanyou Liu  
Elevator Pitch:  
Food has always been a cornerstone of daily life, and today, it’s more important than ever to eat both healthily and enjoyably. Yet, with today’s fast-paced lifestyles, people often lack the time and energy to shop locally or plan meals. That’s why our team of two food enthusiasts is developing an online shopping tool that empowers users to quickly select products tailored to their personal preferences—making healthy, satisfying eating effortless and accessible.
